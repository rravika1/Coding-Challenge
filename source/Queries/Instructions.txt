1. Based on the newly structured relational data model(which can be referred from the ER Diagram), I used Python for data cleaning and utilized mysql.connector to load the cleaned data into MySQL.

2. Please find the Python scripts in the folder named 'PythonScripts' used for data cleaning and loading.

3. We can open the SQL query files with note pad or note pad ++ or MySQL Workbench to review.

4. To execute the SQL Queries, we can execute using MySQL Workbench where the data is loaded.

5. We can also connect to MySQL via Command Prompt using "MySQL -u username -p password". 
   Replace your username and password in the above command.
